The Crop Yield Prediction project uses machine learning to forecast crop yields based on features like state, district, crop year, season, crop type, and cultivation area. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and log-transforming the target variable. The XGBoost Regressor model is trained and fine-tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal performance. The model's accuracy is evaluated through cross-validation and tested on a separate dataset, with results indicating strong predictive capabilities. The final model is saved for deployment, offering valuable insights for farmers and policymakers to improve agricultural outcomes.
